Yes I am

Learning is one of our instinct.
Never give up learning something you don't know.

I once worked as an mechanical design engineer in forklift axle factory.In my childhood, I like machine and want to build a rebot of my own. 
After seven months in the factory in AnQing City, I found that I didn't like the working environment there. The work of every day is the same. There is no innovation, no opportunity and no challenge at all.

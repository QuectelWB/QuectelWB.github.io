About
=====

MDwiki is a CMS/Wiki __completely built in HTML5/Javacript and runs 100% on the client__. No special software installation or server side processing is required. Just upload the `mdwiki.html` shipped with MDwiki into the same directory as your markdown files and you are good to go!

Note: The website you are currently viewing is realized with MDwiki and hosted on [GitHub pages](http://pages.github.com/). [http://mdwiki.info](http://mdwiki.info) redirects here.

Features
--------

  * Built completely in Javascript/HTML5 and __does not require any local or remote installations__
  * Uses [Markdown][markdown] as its input markup language
  * Build on top of [jQuery][jQuery] and [Bootstrap3][bootstrap] to work cross-browser, with responsive layout
  * Extends Markdown with special [_Gimmicks_][gimmicks] that add rich client functions, like syntax highligting via [hightlight.js][highlightjs], [GitHub Gists][gists], or [Google Maps][maps] for geo data
  * Themeable through Bootstrap compatibility, supports all themes from [bootswatch](http://www.bootswatch.com)

Requirements
------------

* Webspace (or a web server that can serve static files)
* Any modern Webbrowser
* [mdwiki.html][download] file

How does it work?
-----------------

Just drop the `mdwiki.html` available from [the download page][download] along with your markdown files on a webspace somewhere. You can pass any url (relative to the `mdwiki.html` file) to mdwiki after the hashbang `#!`:

    http://www.example.com/mdwiki.html#!myfile.md

If you rename the `mdwiki.html` into `index.html`, you can omit the filename on most webservers:

    http://www.example.com/#!myfile.md

MDwiki will load a file called `index.md` from the same directory as the index.html by default, so if you use an `index.md` file as entry point, all you have to do is enter your domain name:

    http://example.com/

Note: There are lots more features over regular Markdown, check out the [quickstart tutorial][quickstart].

Learning is one of our instinct.
Never give up learning something you don't know.

I once worked as an mechanical design engineer in forklift axle factory.In my childhood, I like machine and want to build a rebot of my own. 
After seven months in the factory in AnQing City, I found that I didn't like the working environment there. The work of every day is the same. There is no innovation, no opportunity and no challenge at all.


As an Application Engineer in Quectel is great experience.

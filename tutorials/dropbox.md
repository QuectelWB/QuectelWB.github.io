### Step 1: Get Dropbox account

### Step 2: Download `mdwiki.html` to your Dropbox

  * Rename to index.html if wanted

### Step 3: Edit

  * Use your favorite texteditor

### Step 4: Viewing

  * Use Firefox or any other Browser that is capable of `file:///` uls
  * If using Chrome, add cmdline flags
  * Note that using a standalone webserver is usually better

### Step 5: Public hosting

  * For old Dropbox accounts, you have `Public` folder you can get a link to - this can be used for hosting
  * Newer Dropbox (Past August 2011) sadly don't have `Public` folder and hosting with Dropbox is not possible
